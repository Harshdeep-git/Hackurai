### ⚙ How the AI Works

#### 1. Intelligent Onboarding
When a new user signs up, the AI conducts a short interview with five questions:
1. What are your top 3 goals right now?  
2. How many hours can you dedicate daily to personal growth?  
3. Are you more productive in the morning or night?  
4. What kind of habits would you like to build (Health, Study, Fitness, Mindfulness, etc.)?  
5. Would you like to join community challenges or prefer solo progress?

Based on these inputs, it instantly generates a *smart daily plan* and *habit tracker* customized to the user’s needs.

#### 2. Adaptive Daily Loop
Each day, the AI:
- Tracks your habit completion rate.  
- Analyzes the time and consistency of habit completion.  
- Updates your next day’s plan (reducing or increasing habit targets).  
- Learns behavior patterns (e.g., “You usually skip meditation on weekends”).  

#### 3. Motivation & Habit Retention
- Sends reminders at the right times of the day.  
- Provides dynamic motivational feedback like:  
  > “You’ve been consistent for 4 days straight — let’s push for 7!”  
- Recommends smaller, achievable steps if burnout is detected.

#### 4. Social Intelligence
- Highlights trending challenges that match your goals.  
- Suggests users with similar interests to connect with.  
- Promotes community-driven motivation.
